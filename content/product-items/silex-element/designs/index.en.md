## METAL-FINISHED<br>CONCRETE SKIN

Silex Element’s flagship product, Concrete Skin™, is available in panels with raw textures, concrete or metal finishes. They are composed of a micro-layer of high-performance concrete fused to a mixture of mineral fibers resistant to fire and mold. This innovative concept pushes the limits of concrete and metal, thanks to its ultra-light weight. This lightness and thinness make Concrete Skin™ an uncommon product that is easy to handle and can be installed on almost any substrate. Metal-finished concrete skin is composed of a mixture of recycled and natural metal dusts offering color nuances for each color.

## RAW CONCRETE SKIN

Silex Element’s flagship product, Concrete Skin™, is available in panels with raw textures, concrete or metal finishes, consisting of a high-performance micro-layer of concrete fused with a mixture of fire and mold resistant mineral fibers. This innovative concept pushes the limits of concrete and metal, thanks to its ultra-light weight. This lightness and thinness make Concrete Skin™ an uncommon product that is easy to handle and can be installed on almost any substrate. Shrinkage cavities, color nuances for each color and fine cracks are typical characteristics of concrete. The look and touch are identical to the «real» concrete. The quality you can see and feel in every detail makes it a truly exceptional product.
